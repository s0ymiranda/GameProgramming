    It was created the Cannon_Fire and Cannon classes, the Cannon class is the PowerUp class and the Cannon_Fire is the cannon and shoot of the PowerUp. This PowerUp gives the user to have 2 Cannons, one on each extreme of the paddle, these cannons only have 1 shoot and this shoot can go trough any block giving to the player all the corresponding score and it desapears once it collides to the top of the screen. (Note: you can not get more power ups by destroying blocks with this power up). The player can shoot the cannos by pressing the key 'f'

    There were added 2 new textures to the game, one is the ball or shoot of the cannos, and the other one is the cannon its self.
